Data extraction 
combine the extracted text
BPE algorithm
text encoding
create the model
Data splitting and training 
prepare the fine-tuning model


steps 
1. DATA EXTRACTION 
2. TEXT ENCODING --- CONVERTING THE TEXT DATA TO TENSORS(NUMBERS)(BPE)
3. TRANSORMER MODEL - ENCODER / DECONDER 
4. MODEL TRAINING
