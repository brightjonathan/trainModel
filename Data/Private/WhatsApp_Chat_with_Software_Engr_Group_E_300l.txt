You are to make a summary of the slide beside your names, each person to a particular topic 
The people with blank spaces are those that the topics for them haven’t been sent to us by the lecturer 
The summary should be your own work and should have its own authenticity. This project is required to boost your CA so you’re advised to put in your best…to the extent that, defending your summary wouldn’t be an issue 
Your summary should be printed and spiral binded
Thank you

3/24/24, 11:30 AM - The Code Center: Hello, SE People.
A beautiful day to you all
Big *Thank You* to the course rep and other admins for giving me the opportunity to be here.

My name is James Babalola. I am an alumnus of Babcock University, studied CIS.
I run a coding school in the city of Lagos called  *The Code Center*  where we teach people how to code & design, helping them develop a successful career in it. Over the years, a great number of students from the SCSE, Babcock University (and of course, other institutions) have passed through us at The Code Center, most of who are now doing extremely well in their tech career both at home and abroad.

As summer holiday is approaching for you guys, I'm reaching out to let you all know that if you are interested, you can sign-up for our coding/design bootcamp to equip you with skills that would prepare you for SIWES ahead.
3/24/24, 11:31 AM - The Code Center: Because you guys have 4months holiday to spend, we have designed/carved out the following possible programs for the interested ones among you to choose from.

3/24/24, 11:34 AM - The Code Center: Below is a PDF that contains selected testimonials from just 10 people among several, who are testaments to the value you are guaranteed to get from us. Please take time to read the testimonials
3/24/24, 11:35 AM - The Code Center: <Media omitted>
3/24/24, 11:36 AM - The Code Center: If you are not resident in Lagos or you are limited by distance but you would still like to participate, we have an hostel accommodation that's just about 20mins walk to our office; tho we have very limited space right now because of our SIWES students in training. However this comes at its own cost. 
Also, we have provision for virtual classes if distance is a barrier for you and you don't want to explore the hostel option 

Let me also hint you ahead that *you can do your SIWES at The Code Center by applying for our training programs.* Again, it is for those who are interested. I believe you all know that the 300L people are currently on SIWES - *we have about 22 people at our place who applied for our training program as their SIWES*. I will share more information about this later on
3/24/24, 11:36 AM - The Code Center: I will pause here for now. Would share more information later on.
Please feel free to DM for further enquiry 

Cheers to you all ❤️

8/16/24, 2:57 PM - The Code Center: Good Afternoon, SE People.
I hope you all are enjoying your holiday?

At the end of June 2024, we discharged about 24 students from The School of Computer and Engineering Studies, Babcock University - who came for SIWES at our organization by applying for our training programs - meaning that they paid to learn/acquire knowledge from us.

As they were about rounding off, we requested from them a testimonial of what their experience had been like. In the PDF below, we curated the responses we got from some of them. *Please do me a favour of reading through the document* 🙏
8/16/24, 2:57 PM - The Code Center: <Media omitted>
8/16/24, 2:58 PM - The Code Center: People have come in contact with us at The Code Center and they have been able to find directions for their lives/career. And we just want to be able to make this happen for as many of you as possible. *It will cost you money, no doubt. But it's surely going to be an amazing/transformative/worthwhile experience for you.*
So, if you are interested, then start getting ready to make it a date with us from next year January, 2025

I will share more details with you guys before resumption. In the mean time, feel free to reach out to me for further enquiries.

Cheers to everyone.

James Babalola,
An alumnus of Babcock University & Co-founder of The Code Center 

*P.S.:*
Our office is at Ikeja, Lagos. In case you are not resident in Lagos or you are limited by distance but would still love to participate, we have provision for hostel accommodation which is just about 15 to 20 mins walk to our office (tho it comes at its own cost)

8/26/24, 6:43 PM - The Code Center: When you apply for our training programs at The Code Center as your SIWES, the following are the possible advantages among others....

1: Some of your 400L courses such as Software Engineering, Database Management, Web Design, Internet Technologies, etc would be a walk-over for you.

2: You stand a great chance of being able to build your final year software project by yourself 

3: Depending on how entrepreneurial you are and how well you can manage your time, you'll be able to handle some of your colleagues' final year project and charge them for it 

4: putting 2 and 3 above together, coupled with the projects you must have worked on while on SIWES at The Code Center, you stand a great chance of landing employment upon graduation from the University

There's also the option of remote SIWES.

Anytime you are ready, please feel free to send a DM.

9/3/24, 8:55 AM - The Code Center: The writer of this testimonial is a first class student in Software Engineering (meaning that She's no small fry 😊) Whatever might have made her apply for our training programs at The Code Center as her SIWES (paying to learn)...... Anyways by so doing, we have now been able to help her match her theoretical knowledge with practical, hands-on technical skills. Now, she can proudly call herself a Software Engineer - she's got more than enough results to show for it.
It doesn't matter whether you are on a first class on not; we just want to see how we can be of help to you building a successful career in tech.

In the course of this semester, the school would start requesting that you submit your Acceptance Letter from the organization where you'd be doing your SIWES. At anytime that you are ready for us, you are at liberty to reach out to me.
(There should be no panicking regarding the submission of Acceptance Letter. The deadline for submission is likely to be till the end of February, 2025)
As school resumes today, may the forces be with you all. Wishing you guys the very best.

Hearty congratulations to you all on the    successful completion of your 300L 1st Semester exams. May all the results bring you good news.

As we count down to the commencement of SIWES, kindly take this as a reminder that if you are interested, you can apply for our training programs at The Code Center as your SIWES.
It would cost you money no doubt; but be rest assured that it will pay off for you big in the long run.

Perhaps you are not resident in Lagos or limited by distance but you would still love to participate, we have hostel accommodation that's just about 20mins walk to our office; tho it comes at its own cost.

If you want the option of remote, it's also available.
If you are going to be working somewhere else but then you would still like to participate in our trainings, we have provision for you as well.

Please feel free to DM for more enquiry.

*On a final note, SIWES will officially resume at The Code Center on the 13th of January, 2024. As of now, our organisation has shutdown operations for the year 2024; to reopen again 8th January, 2025 - from which people can begin to come in for enquiries*

Compliments of The Season to you and your loved ones. 
Have a beautiful festive celebration.

Good Evening & Compliments of the Season to everyone.

I do hope that you all had a beautiful Christmas (for those who celebrate it) & New Year celebrations?

Eventually, SIWES is upon us 🙂
I wish you all the very best as it officially kicks off tomorrow.

For our friends that will be joining us at The Code Center, please use this week to get every ounce of rest that you can get. Once we kick off, the days are going to move so fast.
For those who are yet to make up their mind as to whether they should be at The Code Center or not, please do so very quickly. 

Our office will open for business activities from Wednesday, 8th January.  You can start visiting for physical enquiry. *SIWES will commence fully next week Monday, 13th January by 9AM; beginning with an orientation exercise*

Please bear in mind that we have hostel facility for non-Lagos residents or those limited by distance.

The option of remote is also available 

And perhaps you'll be working in an organization but you'd still like to skill up, we have provision for you also. Feel free to DM
